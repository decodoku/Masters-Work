In order to build a useful quantum computer, the problem of noise
has to be tackled. A promising way to get noise under control is the use of
surface codes. The smallest useful surface code is S 17 , which we will analyse in
this work. Using tensor network methods, we analyse the connection between
the fidelity of the cnot-gates in a code with the performance of the code itself
for one round of error correction. Two scenarios were calculated for different
cnot inspired by quantum dot implementations, one starting in a product
state with one measurement round and final measurement and one starting in
a stabilizer state with one measurement round. For purely decoherent noise we
find that the code performance can be predicted well using the channel fidelity
for both scenarios. For more complicated unitary gates that approximate a
cnot and are derived from floating gate implementations we find that for very
small intervals of channel infidelity there is a large spread in code performance.
This shows that we can not predict the performance of a surface code that uses
specific entangling gates well if we only know the channel infidelity of those
entangling gates.
